# Cash Flow Page – Ideas to Improve Profit Visibility

The Cash Flow page is central to understanding business profit, income, and expenses. Below are changes **already done** and **further suggestions** so you can get the full picture at a glance.

---

## Already added (this round)

1. **Profit at a glance**
   - One-line insight: e.g. *"Net profit is 20% of income"* or *"Expenses exceed income by Rs X."*
   - **Profit margin %** when there is income (profit ÷ income × 100).
   - Shown in a highlighted block under the four summary cards; respects branch filter.

2. **Where income comes from / Where money goes**
   - Two panels: **Income by category** (e.g. Sales, Repairs) and **Expenses by category** (e.g. Rent, Salaries).
   - Top categories with amounts; branch-aware when a branch is selected.

## Further suggestions (optional)

### 1. **Time period for summary**
- Add a selector: **This month** | **Last 30 days** | **Last 3 months** | **This year**.
- Summary cards and profit insight would use that period so you can compare “this month profit” vs “last month profit”.

### 2. **Compare to previous period**
- Under each card or under profit insight: *“Up 15% vs last month”* or *“Down 10% vs last month”* for income, expenses, and net profit.
- Helps see if the business is improving or not.

### 3. **Cash runway (sustainability)**
- If expenses > income: *“At current burn rate, cash lasts about X months.”*
- If profit is positive: *“Cash position is healthy.”* or *“X months of expenses covered.”*
- Uses: current cash ÷ average monthly expenses.

### 4. **Profit target / goal**
- Optional monthly profit target (e.g. Rs 50,000).
- Show: *“Target: Rs 50,000 — at 80%”* with a small progress bar.
- Good for motivation and quick “are we on track?” check.

### 5. **Export profit summary**
- Button: **Download profit summary** (PDF or Excel) for the selected period (and branch if selected).
- One-page summary: totals, margin %, top income/expense categories, and maybe the chart.

### 6. **Highlight “Net profit”**
- Make the Net Cash Flow card slightly larger or use a different border/background so it’s the main number you see first.
- Optionally repeat the same number in the page title area: *“Cash Flow — Net profit: Rs X”*.

### 7. **Chart improvements**
- **Period selector for chart:** Last 7 months (current) vs Last 12 months vs This year.
- **Trend line** for profit over time (optional).
- **Click a month** to filter the transaction list to that month.

### 8. **Category breakdown as small charts**
- Replace or complement the “Where income/expense goes” lists with small **pie charts** or **horizontal bar charts** so the split is visible at a glance.

### 9. **Short “insights” list**
- 2–3 bullet points, e.g.:
  - *“Largest expense: Rent (35%).”*
  - *“Profit margin improved vs last month.”*
  - *“Upcoming payments: Rs X due this month.”*

### 10. **Branch comparison (multi-branch)**
- If you have multiple branches: a small table or chart comparing **profit by branch** (e.g. Branch A: Rs X, Branch B: Rs Y) so you see which branch is most profitable.

## Summary

- **Done:** Profit margin %, one-line profit insight, and income/expense by category (branch-aware).
- **Next high-impact:** Time period selector, compare to previous period, and cash runway.
- **Later:** Profit target, export summary, chart period/click-to-filter, and branch comparison.

These will make the Cash Flow page the place where you get the full idea about profit in one view.
